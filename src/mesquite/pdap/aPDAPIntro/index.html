Midford, Theodore Garland Jr., and Wayne Maddison</h4>August 2009<p>This package of modules and library classes was brought over from version5.0 of PDAP.&nbsp; PDAP was originally described in Garland, Dickerman,Janis, and Jones (1993), but several functions pertaining to reconstructed root values were added later (see Garland, T., Jr., P. E. Midford, and A. R. Ives. 1999. An introduction to phylogenetically based statistical methods, with a new method for confidence intervals on ancestral values. <i>American Zoologist</i> 39:374-388.; Garland, T., Jr., and A. R. Ives. 2000. Using the past to predict the present: confidence intervals for regression equations in phylogenetic comparative methods. <i>American Naturalist</i> 155:346-364. and the documentation for PDAP, PDINSTRW.DOC).&nbsp; Current functionality includes what is in PDTREE, i.e., computation of independent contrasts, diagnostic screens to check adequacy of branch lengths, transformations of branch lengths, and some conventional statistical analyses. Other components of PDAP, suchas simulation functionality, will be added soon.

This will, in turn, contain two directories, one titled PDAP and one titled examples.  To install the PDAP modules, the "PDAP" directory must be installed in the "mesquite" directory within the directory titled"Mesquite_Folder".<br><hr><h3><a NAME="examples"></a>Examples</h3>A demo which includes examples based on the 49lbr and appamg91 trees distributedwith DOS PDAP is included.  The examples include a navigation window that allows the user to scroll through the examples in order.  The example set starts with the file Part1.nex.&nbsp;  There are additional examples including an updated versionof the 49lbr tree with full species and character names.<hr><h3><a NAME="citation"></a>Citation</h3>Midford, P.
